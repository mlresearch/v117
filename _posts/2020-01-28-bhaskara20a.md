title: Robust Algorithms for Online $k$-means Clustering
abstract: 'In the online version of the classic $k$-means clustering problem, the
  points of a dataset $u_1, u_2, â€¦$ arrive one after another in an arbitrary order.
  When the algorithm sees a point, it should either add it to the set of centers,
  or let go of the point. Once added, a center cannot be removed. The goal is to end
  up with set of roughly $k$ centers, while competing in $k$-means objective value
  with the best set of $k$ centers in hindsight. Online versions of $k$-means and
  other clustering problem have received significant attention in the literature.
  The key idea in many algorithms is that of adaptive sampling: when a new point arrives,
  it is added to the set of centers with a probability that depends on the distance
  to the centers chosen so far. Our contributions are as follows: <ol> <li/> We give
  a modified adaptive sampling procedure that obtains a better approximation ratio
  (improving it from logarithmic to constant). <li/> Our main result is to show how
  to perform adaptive sampling when data has outliers ($\gg k$ points that are potentially
  arbitrarily far from the actual data, thus rendering distance-based sampling prone
  to picking the outliers). <li/> We also discuss lower bounds for $k$-means clustering
  in an online setting. </ol>'
